<a href="http://vocbench.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank">VocBench</a> is a web-based, multilingual, editing and workflow tool that manages thesauri, authority lists and glossaries using SKOS-XL.<br/>
Designed to meet the needs of semantic web and linked data environments, VocBench provides tools and functionalities that facilitate both <br/>
collaborative editing and multilingual terminology. It also includes administration and group management features that permit flexible roles for<br/>
maintenance, validation and publication.
</p>
<p>
VocBench 2 is developed by a collaboration between the <a href="http://fao.org" target="_blank">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</a> and the <a href="http://art.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank">ART Group</a> of <br/>
the <a href="http://www.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank">University of Rome 'Tor Vergata'</a> and has been improved in the context of the SemaGrow and AgInfra EU projects.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="http://202.73.13.50:55481/vocbench/" target="_blank">sandbox server</a> for testing (some of) its capabilities is hosted by courtesy of the Malaysian research centre MIMOS Berhad.
</p>
<p>
A growing <a href="http://vocbench.uniroma2.it/support/community.jsf" target="_blank">user community</a> has formed around VocBench, mainly made of public organizations which were looking for open source solutions for <br/>
maintaining their thesauri, code lists and authority resources.
</p>
<p>
Born over the success of its first homonimous predecessor, which was developed for internal use in FAO, VocBench 2 represents a major shift <br/>
in both design and outlook. Based on a <a href="http://vocbench.uniroma2.it/documentation/developers.jsf#architecture" target="_blank">service-oriented OSGi architecture</a>, it is designed to allow external developers to add functionality via<br/>
plug-ins without disturbing the core. This allows the current partnership to avoid the administrative burden of managing a full-blown open source<br/>
community, while at the same time maintaining core functionality and making the code public so that others can extend it.<br/>
Version 2 also features other important improvements such as native RDF support, support for different triple-stores,<br/>
looser coupling between modules and more.
</p>
<p>
VocBench business and data access layers are handled by <a href="http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank">Semantic Turkey</a>, an open-source platform for Knowledge Acquisition<br/>
and Management realized by the <a href="http://art.uniroma2.it/" target="_blank">ART Research Group</a> at the University of Rome - Tor Vergata.
